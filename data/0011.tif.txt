preferably 5 to 50 um.

These wafers may be a device wafer having a circuit
(an electronic circuit) formed in the interior thereof or
under the surface structure thereof. Such device wafers
are generally expensive, and is desired to be inspected in
a nondestructive process thereby.

[0040]

In the inventive wafer processing laminate, the
organic film layer (B) contains a fluorescent agent that
emits visible light by irradiation with ultraviolet light.
Accordingly, it is possible to irradiate the wafer having
the organic film layer (B) formed thereon with ultraviolet
light to check the coverage of the organic film layer (B)
on the basis of an emission state in the irradiation.
Therefore, even in the case of such wafers as described
above, the present invention makes it possible to observe
the situation around the portion having unevenness and the
distribution state of the organic film layer (B) in the
wafer surface by a nondestructive and convenient process.

[Organic Film Layer (B)]

The organic film layer (B) is an organic film layer
with a film thickness of less than 100 nm which contains a
fluorescent agent that emits visible light by irradiation
with ultraviolet light. The lower limit of the film
thickness of the organic film layer (B) can be 1 nm, for
example. The film thickness of the organic film layer (B)
is preferably 5 to 50 nm, more preferably 10 to 40 nm.
When the film thickness is 100 nm, an interference fringe
of visible light generates, and the existence of a coating
film (the organic film layer (B)) can be recognized by

visual inspection. In this case, it is possible to check
