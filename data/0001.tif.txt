WAFER PROCESSING LAMINATE, METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING
THEREOF, AND METHOD FOR CHECKING COVERAGE OF ORGANIC FILM
ON WAFER

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]

The present invention relates to a wafer processing
laminate and a method for manufacturing thereof as well as
a method for checking coverage of an organic film on a

wafer.

BACKGROUND ART
[0002]

In circuit forming of semiconductor device wafers,
the circuit line widths have been continuously
miniaturized until now. As a result, wiring of the ten
nano meter range comes to be formed. In photoresist
materials used for forming the wiring, the coating films
also have been shifted to thinner films. For measuring
the film thicknesses of these photoresist materials,
optical film thickness measuring apparatuses such as an
ellipsometer have been used. These methods can be used
for measuring a film thickness applied onto a silicon
wafer with high flatness. However, it has been difficult
to check the state of a thin film formed on a surface
having unevenness in which a circuit has been already
formed, or a surface having another organic film as an
underlayment.
