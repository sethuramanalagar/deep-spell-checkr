The organic film layer (B) may comprise a
thermoplastic organopolysiloxane polymer as a component
other than the fluorescent agent.

[0016]

The thermoplastic organopolysiloxane polymer, in
particular, has low glass transition temperature and
fluidity at the normal temperature, whereby it is
difficult to check the coverage of the organic film by
observing the cross section of a divided wafer.
Accordingly, the inventive wafer processing laminate can
be favorably applied when the thermoplastic
organopolysiloxane polymer is used.

[0017]

It is also preferable that the fluorescent agent be
a fluorescent whitening agent.

[0018]

When the fluorescent agent is a fluorescent
whitening agent, it is easy to check the emission. It
becomes more favorable to use the inventive wafer
processing laminate.

[0019]

The present invention also provides a method for
checking coverage of an organic film layer (B) with a film
thickness of less than 100 nm, being formed on a wafer
having a surface on which unevenness and/or a protective
organic film layer (A) is formed, characterized in that:

the organic film layer (B) comprises a fluorescent
agent that emits visible light by irradiation with
ultraviolet light, and

the wafer having the organic film layer (B) formed
thereon is subjected to irradiation with ultraviolet light

to check the coverage of the organic film layer (B) by an
