an uneven surface on which a circuit is formed and/or an
organic film as an underlayment, and a temporary adhesive
material used for a step of grinding the back surface of a
circuit-formed device wafer and a step of forming wiring
in the back surface of the circuit-forming surface in
order to use through silicon via (TSV) for three-
dimensional mounting of a semiconductor (see Patent
Literature 1, for example), the state of the film forming
can be checked by observation of the cross section, etc.
since the film thickness is thicker than photoresist
material and so on for forming a circuit.

[0004]

However, in case of forming a thin film with the
thickness of less than 100 nm onto a wafer having an
uneven surface on which a circuit is formed and/or an
organic film as an underlayment, there has been no method
to check the coverage conveniently by a nondestructive

process to manufacture a thin film wafer.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
TECHNICAL PROBLEM
[0006]

The present invention was accomplished in view of

 

the above-described problems. It is an object of the
present invention to provide a wafer processing laminate
in which the coverage of the thin film can be checked by a

nondestructive and convenient method, with the wafer being
