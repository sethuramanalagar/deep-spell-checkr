light. Although FIG. 1 shows the wafer having a surface
on which unevenness and a protective organic film layer
(A) are formed, it is to be noted that the wafer in the
present invention may have a surface on which unevenness
or a protective organic film layer (A) is formed.

[0032]

In such a wafer processing laminate, it is possible
to check the state of forming the organic film layer (B)
formed on the wafer on the basis of a difference between
the emitted portions and portions without emission by
applying ultraviolet light (200 to 400 nm, preferably 300
to 400 nm) and checking emitted visible light.

[0033]

Hereinafter, each component of the inventive wafer
processing laminate will be specifically described.
[0034]

Tllustrative examples of a wafer in the present
invention include:

(a) a wafer having a surface on which unevenness is formed,
(b) a wafer having a surface on which a protective organic
film layer (A) is formed, and

(c) a wafer having a surface on which both of the
unevenness and a protective organic film layer (A) are
formed.

[0035]

The unevenness (fine ruggedness) formed on a wafer
is not particularly limited in its shape. In general,
however, illustrative examples thereof include a spherical,
columnar, and polygonal prism structure having a
difference of altitude of 0.1 to 500 um and a size within
a 1 to 1000 um square, as well as a linear structure
having a width of 0.1 to 1000 um. When the film is formed

on the wafer, such a structure can generate thickness
