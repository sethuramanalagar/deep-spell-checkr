reusable, even when the thin film with a film thickness of
less than 100 nm is formed onto a wafer having an uneven
surface on which a circuit is formed and/or an organic
film as an underlayment; the manufacturing method thereof;
and a method for checking coverage of the organic film on

a wafer.

SOLUTION TO PROBLEM
[0007]

To accomplish the foregoing objects, the present
invention provides a wafer processing laminate comprising
a wafer having a surface on which unevenness and/or a
protective organic film layer (A) is formed, and an
organic film layer (B) with a film thickness of less than
100 nm formed on the wafer,

the organic film layer (B) comprising a fluorescent
agent that emits visible light by irradiation with
ultraviolet light.

[0008]

In such a wafer processing laminate, when the wafer
having the organic film layer (B) formed thereon is
irradiated with ultraviolet light, it is possible to check
the coverage of the organic film layer (B) on the basis of
the emission state in the irradiation. This makes it
possible to check the coverage of an organic film layer
(B) with a film thickness of less than 100 nm formed on
any wafers having a surface on which unevenness is formed
(unevenness~forming surface), a surface on which a
protective organic film layer (A) is formed (protective
organic film layer (A)-forming surface), or a surface on
which both of them are formed, by the convenient method in
which the emission is checked without destructing the

wafer, with the wafer being reusable.
