The wafer having a surface on which unevenness
and/or a protective organic film layer (A) is formed may
be a device wafer having a circuit formed.

[0010]

The device wafers described above are generally
expensive, and the check method is desired to be
nondestructive and convenient, with the wafer being
reusable. Accordingly, it is more favorable to adopt the
inventive wafer processing laminate.

[0011]

The organic film layer (B) with a film thickness of
less than 100 nm may be a spin-coated film.
[0012]

The spin-coated film is a film formed by a spin-
coating method. On a surface having unevenness, the spin-
coating method particularly tends to form coating
irregularities around the unevenness, and can have
portions without forming the film in a very thin film
thickness of less than 100 nm. The inventive wafer
processing laminate can be favorably used for a purpose of
checking such coating irregularities and coating failure.
[0013]

The organic film layer (B) preferably has a film
thickness of 5 to 50 nm.

[0014]

When the film thickness is 100 nm or more, it is
possible to check visually under a visible light since an
interference fringe generates. When the film thickness is
less than 100 nm, particularly 50 nm or less, however, it
becomes difficult to check visually under a visible light,
and the inventive wafer processing laminate can be more

favorably used thereby.
