above, the present invention makes it possible to
conveniently observe the distribution state in a wafer
surface by nondestructive process using visual inspection
or observation through microscope.

[Fluorescent Agent]

The fluorescent agent is not particularly limited as
far as it is fluorescent material that emits visible light
by irradiation with ultraviolet light. It is preferable
that the wavelength of the ultraviolet light to be applied
be in a range of 200 to 400 nm, particularly 300 to 400
nm; and the emitted visible light have a wavelength ina
range of 380 to 750 nm, particularly 400 to 500 nm.

[0061]

| Fluorescent whitening agents are known to fulfill

the foregoing wavelengths of light absorption and emission,
and are preferably used as the fluorescent agent since

they are easy to procure and have lower risk.

[0062]

The fluorescent whitening agent may include the
following examples.
[0063]

Distyrylbenzenes such as 1,4-distyrylbenzene and
4,4'’-bis(2-methoxystyryl) biphenyl each having a cyano
group(s); distyrylbiphenyls such as disodium salt of 4,4’-
di(2-sulfostyryl)biphenyl, disodium salt of 4,4’-di(3-
sulfostyryl)biphenyl, disodium salt of 4,4’-di(4-chloro-3-
sulfostyryl)biphenyl, and disodium salt of 4,4’-di(6-
chloro-3-sulfostyryl)biphenyl; divinylstilbenes such as
4,4’-di(ethoxycarbonylvinyl) stilbene and 4,4’-

di (cyanovinyl) stilbene; triazinylaminostilbenes such as
1,3,5-triazinyl derivative of 4,4’-diaminostilbene-2,2'-

disulfonic acid; stilbenyl-2H-triazoles such as stilbenyl-
