processing laminate in which the coverage of the organic
film can be checked by a nondestructive and convenient
method that can reuse the wafer.

[0068]

After the step of forming, it is preferable to
perform the step of subjecting the wafer having the
organic film layer (B) formed thereon to irradiation with
ultraviolet light to check the coverage of the organic
film layer (B) by an emission state in the irradiation.
Such a checking step makes it convenient to check a
portion(s) where the organic film layer (B) is not formed.
[0069]

In the present invention, it is also possible to
manufacture a thin film wafer by forming a layer of the
third component such as a self-adhesive and an adhesive
onto a wafer on which the organic film layer (B) is formed,
further forming a support on the layer of the third
component in accordance with needs, and subjecting the
wafer surface that is not laminated (the back surface) to
grinding process, etc. In this case, it is possible to
use a wafer processing laminate in which the coverage of
the organic film layer (B) is recognized as good by the
foregoing checking step. It is also possible to use a
wafer processing laminate manufactured under the same
conditions as for the wafer processing laminate, the
coverage of which is recognized as good, except that a
fluorescent agent is not contained.

[Method for Checking Coverage of Organic Film]

The inventive method for checking coverage of an
organic film is a method for checking coverage of an
organic film layer (B) with a film thickness of less than

100 nm, being formed on a wafer having a surface on which
