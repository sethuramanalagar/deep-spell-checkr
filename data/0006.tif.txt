emission state in the irradiation.
[0020]

Such a method for checking coverage of an organic
film makes it possible to check the coverage of an organic
film by a nondestructive and convenient process that can
reuse the wafer.

[0021]

The present invention further provides a method for
manufacturing a wafer processing laminate, including the
step of forming an organic film layer (B) with a film
thickness of less than 100 nm onto a wafer having a
surface on which unevenness and/or a protective organic
film layer (A) is formed, characterized in that:

the organic film layer (B) comprises a fluorescent
agent that emits visible light by irradiation with
ultraviolet light.

[0022]

Such a method for manufacturing a wafer processing
laminate makes it possible to securely produce a wafer
processing laminate in which the coverage of the organic
film can be checked by a nondestructive and convenient
method that can reuse the wafer.

[0023]

It is preferable that the method further comprise
the step of subjecting the wafer having the organic film
layer (B) formed thereon to irradiation with ultraviolet
light after the step of forming to check the coverage of
the organic film layer (B) by an emission state in the
irradiation.

[0024]

Such a step for checking makes it more convenient to

recognize a portion where the organic film layer (B) is

not formed.
