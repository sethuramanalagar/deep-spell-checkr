the organic film layer (B) visually under visible light
without using the inventive wafer processing laminate.
When the film thickness is less than 100 nm, however, the
interference fringe becomes thinner, and hard to check by
visual inspection. Particularly, when the film thickness
is 5 to 50 nm, the visual inspection becomes difficult,
and it is more favorable to use the inventive wafer
processing laminate.

The component in the organic film layer (B) other
than the fluorescent agent is not particularly limited.
It is preferable not to contain solid contents with a size
larger than the film thickness to be formed.

[0043]

As for the component in the organic film layer (B)
other than the fluorescent agent, a thermoplastic
organopolysiloxane polymer can be used. The thermoplastic
organopolysiloxane polymer has low glass transition
temperature and fluidity at the normal temperature.
Accordingly, this cannot always be observed by a method in
which the cross section of a wafer is observed to measure
the coating thickness. Therefore, the inventive wafer
processing laminate can be used more favorably.

[0044]

As the thermoplastic organopolysiloxane polymer
contained in the organic film layer (B), the structure is
not particularly limited. Illustrative examples thereof
include a non-reactive organopolysiloxane that contains
99.000 to 99.999 mol% of a siloxane unit represented by
RiMRMsido,. (D unit), 1.000 to 0.001 mol% of a siloxane
unit represented by R’?RMRYSiOi2 (M unit), and 0.000 to
0.500 mol% of a siloxane unit represented by R'°Si03/2 (T

unit), having a weight average molecular weight of 200,000
