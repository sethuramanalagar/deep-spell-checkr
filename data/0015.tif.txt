including alkyl groups such as a methyl group, an ethyl
group, a n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl
group, a t-butyl group, a n-pentyl group, a cyclopentyl
group, and a n-hexyl group, cycloalkyl groups such as a
cyclohexyl group, aryl groups such as a phenyl group anda
tolyl group; and their halogenated groups in which part of
or all of the hydrogen atom(s) are substituted with
halogen atom(s), as well as a hydroxy group. In these
groups, a methyl group is commonly used.

. The organopolysiloxane resin having an R27 R?7R235401/2
unit (M unit) and a SiOgsz unit (Q unit) (hereinafter, also
referred to as a MQ resin) may contain a hydroxy group
bonded to a silicon atom. The content of the hydroxy
group per 100 g of a MO resin is about 0 to 4.0% by mass.
This MQ resin may contain relatively small amount of an
R249i03/2 unit (T unit) and an R?°R?°S 4109/2 unit (D unit). In
this formula, R**, R*°, and R25 each independently represent
an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a hydroxy group, and
specific examples thereof include the same groups in the
foregoing examples of R**, R*?, and R*.

[0051]

In the thermoplastic resin modified
organopolysiloxane, the organopolysiloxane and the
organopolysiloxane resin are subjected to dehydration
condensation generally in a ratio of 99:1 to 50:50.

[0052]

The dehydration condensation reaction may be carried
out in a solvent such as pentane, hexane, cyclopentane,
cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, octane, isooctane, decane,
undecane, isododecane, limonene, pinene, and toluene;

generally toluene. This reaction may also be performed in
