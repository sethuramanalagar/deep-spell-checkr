ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION
[0025]

In the inventive wafer processing laminate, by
irradiating the wafer having the organic film layer (B)
formed thereon with ultraviolet light, it is possible to
check the coverage of the organic film layer (B) on the
basis of the emission state in the irradiation. This
makes it possible to check the coverage of an organic film
layer (B) with a film thickness of less than 100 nm formed
on any wafers having an unevenness-forming surface, a
protective organic film layer (A)-forming surface, or a
surface on which both of them are formed, by the
convenient method in which the emission is checked without

destructing the wafer, with the wafer being reusable.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0027]

Hereinafter, the present invention will be
specifically described.
[0028]

As described above, it has been demanded a wafer
processing laminate in which the coverage of the organic

film can be checked by a nondestructive and convenient
