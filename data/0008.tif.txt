method that can reuse the wafer, when an organic film
layer (B) with a film thickness of less than 100 nm is
formed on any wafers having an unevenness-forming surface,
a protective organic film layer (A)-forming surface, or a
surface on which both of them are formed.

[0029]

The present inventors have diligently studied to
accomplish the foregoing objects. As a result, the
present inventors have found that the coverage of an
organic film layer (B) can be checked when the organic
film layer (B) with a film thickness of less than 100 nm
is formed on any wafer, the surface of which has
unevenness, .a protective organic film layer (A), or both
of them, by formulating a fluorescent agent that emits
visible light by irradiating the organic film layer (B)
with ultraviolet light, and by observing the visible light
emitted by irradiating the ultraviolet light; thereby
brought the present invention to completion.

[0030]

Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present
invention will be specifically described with referring to
FIGS., but the present invention is not limited thereto.

[Wafer Processing Laminate]

FIG. 1 is a schematic cross sectional view showing
an example of a wafer processing laminate of the present
invention. As shown in FIG. 1, in the inventive wafer
processing laminate 10, the organic film layer (B) 13 with
a film thickness of less than 100 nm is formed on the
wafer 11 having a surface on which unevenness and the
protective organic film layer (A) 12 are formed. This
organic film layer (B) 13 contains a fluorescent agent

that emits visible light by irradiation with ultraviolet
