2H-naphtho[1,2-d]triazole and bis(1,2,3-triazol-2-

yl) stilbene; benzoxazoles such as stilbenylbenzoxazole,
bis (benzoxazole), and 1,4-bis(2-benzoxazolyl) naphthalene;
furans; benzofurans; benzoimidazoles; coumarins. The
fluorescent whitening agent is preferably distyrylbenzenes
and benzoxazoles. The foregoing fluorescent whitening
agent makes it easier to check the coating situation by
the emission.

[0064]

The content of the fluorescent agent in the organic
film layer (B) is generally 0.1 to 50% by mass, preferably
1.0 to 30% by mass, more preferably 2.0 to 20% by mass.
When the amount is 0.1% by mass or more, the emission can
be recognized easily; and when the amount is 50% by mass
or less, the film thickness becomes hard to variate.

[Method for Manufacturing a Wafer Processing Laminate]

The inventive method for manufacturing a wafer
processing laminate is a method including the step of
forming an organic film layer (B) with a film thickness of
less than 100 nm onto a wafer having a surface on which
unevenness and/or a protective organic film layer (A) is
formed, and is characterized in that: the organic film
layer (B) comprises a fluorescent agent that emits visible
light by irradiation with ultraviolet light.

[0066]

The specifics of the structure of each organic film
layer and the methods for forming the organic film layer
(B) are the same as described in the items of the wafer
processing laminate.

[0067]
Such a method for manufacturing a wafer processing

laminate makes it possible to securely produce a wafer
