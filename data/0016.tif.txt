the presence of an amine-type catalyst such as aqueous
ammonia, triethylamine, and pyridine; generally aqueous
ammonia. The reaction time is preferably 12 to 100 hours.
[0053]

In the organopolysiloxane obtained after the
reaction, the remained hydroxy group(s) may be converted
to a trimethylsiloxy group(s) by dissolving the obtained
organopolysiloxane into a solvent such as toluene, adding
5 to 20 parts by mass of hexamethylsilazane to 100 parts
by mass of the organopolysiloxane, and refluxing the
mixture for 3 to 5 hours.

[0054]

The obtained resin modified organopolysiloxane may
also be dissolved and precipitated in such a way that the
obtained organopolysiloxane is dissolved into a good
solvent such as hexane, and mixed with 1.5 to 3 times of
the total amount of a poor solvent such as acetone. It is
also possible to use this resin modified
organopolysiloxane precipitated as an under layer.

[0055]

The obtained resin modified organopolysiloxane
generally has a weight average molecular weight of 400,000
or more in terms of a value measured by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) in accordance with a calibration
curve with polystyrene standard.

[0056]

The method for forming the organic film layer (B) is
not particularly limited. The method includes spin-
coating, Slit coating, spray coating, vacuum deposition,
and film laminating. For example, when spin-coating
method is used, a spin-coating film is formed as the
organic film layer (B).
