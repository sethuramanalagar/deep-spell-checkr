variation of a formed film and coating failure at a
portion having a difference of altitude. At a portion
having a difference of altitude, reflected light is not
normally returned, whereby the film thickness cannot be
measured in some cases by an optical film thickness
measuring apparatus, which is generally used for measuring
a film thickness. It is also impossible to measure
coating failure precisely when the coating failure portion
is smaller than the diameter of the measuring spot.

In visual inspection, a wafer surface having a
protective organic film layer (A) formed thereon shows
small change when an organic film layer (B) is formed
thereon. Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish
coating failure and coating irregularity. Such a change
can be detected by using an optical film thickness
measuring apparatus in the diameter of the measuring spot,
but the problem portions are difficult to find over an
entire wafer.

[0037]

The protective organic film layer (A) is not
particularly limited as far as it is a film formed for
protecting a wafer surface. In general, thermosetting
material is used, including polyimide, polybenzoxazole,
Silicone modified polymers, silicone polymers, acrylic
polymers, epoxy polymers, and organic films containing
Silica filler. They may be photosensitive, and in that
case, unevenness shape is generally formed at the same
time.

The thickness of the protective organic film layer

(A) is not particularly limited. The film thickness is

generally 1 to 200 um, preferably 2 to 100 um, more
